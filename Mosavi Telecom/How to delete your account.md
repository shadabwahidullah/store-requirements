# How to Delete Your Account

This guide outlines the steps to permanently delete your account within our app. Please follow these instructions carefully. Once your account is deleted, this action cannot be undone, and all associated data will be permanently removed.

1.  **Log in to our app:**
    Launch the application on your device and log in using your registered email address and password.

2.  **Open the navigation drawer:**
    Once you are logged in, locate the **hamburger icon** (usually represented by three horizontal lines) in the top corner of the screen (typically the top-left or top-right). Tap on this icon to open the app's main menu, also known as the navigation drawer.

3.  **Navigate to Settings:**
    Within the navigation drawer, scroll through the list of options and tap on **Settings**. This will take you to the application's settings screen.

4.  **Select Delete Account:**
    On the Settings screen, look for the option labeled **Delete Account**. Tap on this option to proceed with the account deletion process.

5.  **Confirm Account Deletion:**
    After selecting "Delete Account," a confirmation dialog will appear on your screen. This dialog is a final warning before permanent account deletion. It will likely ask you to confirm that you understand the consequences of deleting your account and wish to proceed.

    Carefully read the message in the confirmation dialog. If you are sure you want to delete your account, tap on the **Confirm** button (the text on the button may vary, such as "Delete," "Yes, Delete My Account," etc.).

6.  **Account Deletion Successful:**
    Once you confirm, the app will begin the account deletion process. Upon successful deletion, you will typically be logged out of the app, and you may see a confirmation message indicating that your account has been successfully deleted.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data Loss:** Deleting your account will result in the permanent loss of all data associated with your account. This may include your profile information, saved preferences, uploaded content, purchase history, and any other data linked to your account within the app.
* **Irreversible Action:** Please note that account deletion is a permanent action and cannot be reversed. Once your account is deleted, we will not be able to recover your data.
* **Contact Support:** If you encounter any issues during this process or have any questions regarding account deletion, please contact our support team through the app's help section or via email at [Insert your support email address here].

By following these steps, you can successfully delete your account from our app. Please ensure you understand the implications before proceeding with the deletion.
